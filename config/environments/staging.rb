  # Inserts middleware to perform automatic connection switching.

  # middleware. The `delay` is used to determine how long to wait after a write
  # to send a subsequent read to the primary.

  # The `database_resolver` class is used by the middleware to determine which
  # database is appropriate to use based on the time delay.

  # class timestamps to determine how long to wait before reading from the
